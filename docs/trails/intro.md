# Introduction

:::info Summary
Bohemian Trails are **unmarked** **natural** trails on public trails, tracks, paths, and (as less as possible) roads. 
:::

## Concept

Prague is very hilly and has large number of parks, forest parks and forests. Prague Trails exploit these two properties and offers trails with elevation loss and touch of nature in the city. Roads with traffic and more broadly roads with solid surface are avoided if possible.

## Distance

The courses are planned to be between 20-30 km long.

## Transportation

All trails start and end close to the train station and/or tram stop. If you live downtown take train or tram to get close to the starting point. If you live close to the starting point ride the trail and then take train or tram to get you back home.

## Navigation

As the trails are not marked it's necessary (at least for first ride) to use GPS navigation device or a phone with navigation app. For GPX files for each trail please see [Trails](trails) section.

## Difficulty

As trails are planned on existing public trails and paths os it's not easy to determine difficulty of each trail. Generally the trails can be comfortably ridden with cross-country hardtail mountain bike, they are not suitable for beginners or non-mountain bike. Some more challenging passages can be crossed on feet if a rider does not feel comfortable with riding it.
