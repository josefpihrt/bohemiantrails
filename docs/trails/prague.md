# Prague Trails

:::info Summary
Prague Trails are **unmarked** **natural** trails on public trails, tracks, paths, and (as less as possible) roads. 
:::

## Concept

Prague is very hilly and has large number of parks, forest parks and forests. Prague Trails exploit these two properties and offer natural trails through the city. Roads with traffic or even solid surface are avoided if possible.

## Distance

The courses are planned to be between 20-30 km long.

## Transportation

All trails start and end close to the train station and sometimes tram stop. If you live downtown take train or tram to get close to the starting point. If you live close to the starting point ride the trail and then take train or tram to get you back home.
