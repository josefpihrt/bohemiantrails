# Introduction

> Prague and its surrounding areas are the promised land for cross country biking.
Hilly terrain with rapidly changing sections of (forest) parks, forests, urban and industrial areas creates unique mosaic which deserved to be ridden with mountain bike.

Bohemian Trails:

✔️ are unmarked (navigation device or smartphone with navigation app is needed at least for first ride) <br />
✔️ go through public trails, tracks and paths with natural surface <br />
✔️ avoid roads with traffic where possible <br />
✔️ avoid paths with solid surface where possible <br />
✔️ can be comfortably ridden with XC hardtail bike (preferrably with dropper post) <br />
✔️ are 20-30 km long (1-2 hours ride) <br />
✔️ have total ascent between 300 and 500 meters <br />
✔️ start and end near train station to provide easy transportation (sometimes also near metro station or tram stop) <br />
✔️ do not have defined difficulty but are neither easy nor hard <br />
✔️ should be ridden in a recommended direction


❌ are not trails in a sense of dedicated man-made trails such as those in bike parks <br />
❌ do not contain any artificial obstacles although many unofficial trail parks are present along the way <br />
❌ are not intended to ridden by beginner <br />
❌ are not intended to ridden by non-mountain bike <br />
